Scripts to assist in various tasks
==================================

The scripts are divided into directories named according to the type of your
assistance.

E.g: directory `network` &#8212; scripts related to network tasks.

> **Note:** Some scripts must be adapted to work correctly for your use case.

> **Note:** Some scripts make use of tools that, possibly, are not installed in
>           your environment (some distros do not bring by default).
>           Installation will be requested.
